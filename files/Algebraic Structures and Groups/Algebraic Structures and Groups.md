# Grade Guard Web App Proposal

## **GRADE GUARD: A GRADE CALCULATOR AND TRACKER FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES MINDANAO STUDENTS:**
**Grade Guard: A Grade Calculator and Tracker for UP Mindanao Students**

## **Group Members:**
- Zildjian California
- Ravhen Grageda

## **Background Information**
Students often struggle to track their academic performance, leading to uncertainty about whether they are meeting their goals (e.g., maintaining scholarships, Latin honors eligibility, or simply passing courses). The existing Grade Guard program was created as a compliance for CMSC 18 in **C programming** , but this project aims to enhance it by converting it into a **fully functional web application** for greater accessibility and usability.

## **Objectives**
- Develop a web-based tool where students can input their grades and **predict their future grades** based on assessment weights.
- Provide a **searchable and filterable** student and course database.
- Offer **visualized reports** for students to analyze their academic progress.
- Allow students to set **target General Weighted Average (GWA)** and track if they are still aligned with their goals.
- Enable students to **export reports** for personal tracking or academic purposes.

## **Data Sources**
- **User Inputs:** Students will manually input their grades and course details.
- **University Grading System:** The web app will use **UP Mindanao’s official grading scale**.
- **External APIs:**
  - **Google Sheets API** (for exporting grade reports)
  - **Chart.js / Recharts** (for visualizing grade trends)
  - **Firebase Authentication** (for secure student logins)
